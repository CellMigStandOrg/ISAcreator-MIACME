# ISAcreator-MIACME
A package of the [ISAcreator tool](http://github.com/ISA-tools/ISAcreator) including the ISA-Tab MIACME configurations, i.e. templates to build MIACME-compliant metadata in ISAcreator, can be downloaded from here:

java -cp ISAcreator.jar org.isatools.isacreator.launch.ISAcreatorApplication
```
